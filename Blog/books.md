# My Book Recommendations
As an avid audible listener I've got to say my library has grown continually for the however many years I've actually been a member. Far faster than the 1 Book per month that the default subscription would imply. 166 Titles would imply I'd been a member for almost 14 years. 

## Off to be the Wizard (Magic 2.0)
Scott Meyer the author of the book series has a nack for unique takes on older concepts. It's definitely a series which gets a lot of extra leg room in the audio book as some of the descriptions can be a little less descriptive than I'd typically want, but with Luke Denis narrating it's a great listen. I enjoyed it up until the 5th book where the writing of the magical people started to drift away into areas that made some sections difficult to listen to. Without spoiling anything, one of the main characters repeatedly makes an unmagically gifted person go get food and prepare it for them, when they could literally just pull it out of their hat. Despite having promised to provide it on mulitple ocassions. 

- Off to Be the Wizard
- Spell or High Water
- An Unwelcome Quest
- Fight or Flight
- Out of Spite, Out of Mind (And this is where the series kinda lost me)
- The Vexed Generation 

Overall definitely worth a read. My brother showed me the kindle version which has animated illustrations at points, making the book a fun read or listen.

## Master of Formalities
Another Scott Meyer book which has an interesting take on an old concept. It definitely shows that he had gained a lot of writing experience during the process of the first couple Off to be the Wizard books, and honestly it was enjoyable, if a bit slow to get started. This one doesn't start a series so it's a substantially smaller commitment than the Magic 2.0 series at only a single 15 hour listen. Without spoiling, think the perspective of the butlers in an interstellar human empire where cultures have vastly diverged. 

## Bobiverse
The original trilogy is a delightfully well put together arc with great story and characters. The new books which are still coming out, I'm waiting with baited breath on each of them. Well some of the decisions the Denis e. Taylor made in the book would frustrate those who had contradictory head cannons, the answers are good enough and the characters are still enjoyable enough to make the additional books feel worthy of the original trilogy. Definitely a must read/ listen science fiction experience. If you look at the authors blog he has mentioned that it has been picked up for an option on a TV series. Honestly if it could get the budget to do it justice, I think it could make a great movie series, so I'm hyped to see if anything ever comes of that. 

- We are Legion (We are Bob)
- For We are Many
- All These Worlds

- Heaven's River
- Not Till We are Lost 

and hopefully more to come. If this series turns into Denis e. Taylor's forever series getting more and more material fleshing out and expanding the cannon, I'll be a happy fan for as long as they keep coming out. 

## Quantum Earth
Another great Denis e. Taylor series. This one is definitely less beloved, but still a great pair of books. With more almost definitely to come. I think the reason why this series is less beloved than the Bobiverse series is likely that it ocassionally hits a bit too close to home. Especially the second book. Without spoiling too much, think the tv show sliders, but with a much less populated universe. I'll continue to listen to these books, but I hope that a good plot thread can be added to remove the problem of the week feeling that the books could certainly drift towards. That or that the series will fully dive into that direction digging in and going the Martian or more level of detail on its solutions.

- Outland 
- Earthside

I think the titles give you some idea as to what's going on in the series. But I've been careful to not spoil anything significantly plote relevant. 

## Roadkill
This book should go problem of the week series, if it ever gets a series. It is nice well contained little plot with no need for more. But I'd still probably tune in to listen to more. I'll leave this one entirely spoiler free as I can't think of a way to give a hint without substantial spoilers here. Definitely some more classic Denis e. Taylor.

## The Singularity Trap
Great book, another Denis e. Taylor special. Honestly don't want a sequel to it, because it is so neatly well contained with no great plot hooks for future stories. A great answer to the Fermi Paradox. I will say this is the one book by this author that I haven't felt the compunction to re-listen to, not that's bad, it's great, just not something that really needs repeating.
