Writing my post here a day late because there isn't much to promote here. Last week I wrote on my writing progress and I'm still working on my writing. Chapter 2's content is now ready for review. With Chapter 3 coming along nicely. That should be done by the end of the coming week with a start on Chapter 4, although I do think Chapter 4 is likely to take a little longer as while it's also got writing work to be done there's collation of the various bits of data to make it both pretty, interesting, and informative. 

## Networking Headaches
At some point in the coming week I've got to transfer a bunch of servers from one location to another. 

- Mini Server with a bunch of VMs. 
- 5 Raspberry Pis 
- 1 or 2 switches depending on how I structure the networking.
