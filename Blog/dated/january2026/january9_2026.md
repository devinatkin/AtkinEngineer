- If I had more time I would have written you a shorter letter. There's some rumblings of a potential startup in the future; however, only time will tell. Regardless of if it ends up occuring it's brought to mind old lessons in project management. For instance the true cost of employment for an engineering undergraduate intern comes to roughly $100 per hour. That seems insane; however, it needs to accomodate equipment they're using, taxes on their time, and even the lights in the office. To avoid sounding too much like a LinkedIn lunatic I'll leave this particular thought with two tidbits, one that quote in sentence one is often falsely attributed to Mark Twain (Apparently falsely, I couldn't be bothered to look it up, and two )

- My work this week has been heavily hamstrung by the internet so I'm going to pretend like the week is just a slow start. Essentially it started with discovering a bug that required me to rerun a chunk of code that I had originally let run over a full week. Getting the time down after the bug was found took an annoying amount of time; however, what I've been able to see so far looks like the bug is fully solved. Supervising a terminal is annoying; however, due to networking restrictions I've got to run stuff through a Tailscale tunnel which has proved moderately unstable at times. 

- I'm excited to get back into TA duties next week. I'm hoping to get an additional contract to be able to maintain a full TA assignment like last semester; however, we'll see how things end up playing out.
