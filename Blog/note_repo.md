# Possibilities
It's far too easy to gain a bunch of familiarity with a system and then have to walk away for a month, two months, even a decade. Then you come back and can't remember how anything worked. Notes and note repos are a great way to write things in a setup which doesn't end with you frustratedly rebuilding your skillset the same slow way that you built it to begin with. Instead you write things in your own words with descriptions of how you did each thing. Even the act of note taking helps some people, but even if not having your own descriptions of the problems should be a minimal problem.
