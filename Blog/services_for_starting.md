# Services for Starting 
So you're starting a new business and want to setup your IT services. There are a lot of different things you'll need and a lot of different ways to set them up. Here are a few items to get yourself started. I'll try and keep this up to date as I think of more items that may be relevant to staritng a small business. So far Email Services.

## Email Accounts
Using @gmail looks tacky, at least in my opinion. It is at least not as bad as using an ISP provided address like @telus or @shaw (Goodness why are those even offered). Services abound to have your own custom domain email address.

- Google Workspace ($7.80 - $23.40 CAD per Month). I personally have a middling plan in order to get more pooled storage. This may appeal if your a fan of other google services. I was initially drawn into this service as I liked the ecosystem, Google Domains for a registrar, Google Workspace for email, Google Cloud for computing. 
- Proton Email ($0 - $12.99 USD per Month). So for the free you just get an @proton mail address, which isn't perfect, but it has a step up on the other addresses because among a certain crowd proton mail is revered for being great for privacy. But with a paid plan you can add your own custom domain and get a bunch of features convenient for businesses, multiple addresses, vpn, and a password manager, sharable with up to 10 other people. Honestly a great price for the service.
- AWS Workmail ($4 USD per month). It's cheap and associated with your AWS account. That plus the ability to add amazon's equivalent of google docs makes it a good way to add items piece meal. It plays nicely with other amazon services which can make it a good option for startups not wanting a lot of management overhead jumping between platforms. 
- Zoho Mail (€0.90 - €3.60 per month). Custom domains, and super cheap. Not a lot of features, especially at the lower end, but honestly amazing value for money. For the higher end you can even white label the mail so that it matches your company branding. 
- Alimail ($13.50 per month for 3 users). If you don't mind the association with Alibaba, and with good cost scaling ($135 per year) it's a reasonable offer when you need multiple accounts. 
- Microsoft 365 Business ($8.10 - $29.80 per month). If you're already locked into using Word, Excel, Powerpoint and the like then you might want to look at a business microsoft account. Plus that should play nicely with Azure cloud I'm sure, which as another major cloud provider has a certain value to it. 

I haven't tried the majority of these options, but they are all ones that look quite good on paper and have the backing of a larger company. If you have specific data needs or peripheral services it'll change what makes the most sense; however, barring VERY strict data requirements don't go self-hosted. It's far too much trouble to manage the service on your own, and far too easy to accident yourself onto a black list. Don't get me wrong there are open source options for running your own mail server, but you're going to want to have an IT department of your own to handle any complications that may come of it. Even large organizations like Universities know it's cheaper and easier to just let someone who specializes in it handle the job. 

## Cloud Services 
You need all sorts of Cloud computers. 

- Alibaba Cloud
- Azure Cloud
- Amazon Webservices
- Google Cloud
- IBM Cloud
- Digital Ocean
- Oracle Cloud

There are a lot of different cloud providers out there. Each with different flavors and different levels of hassle. Some resellers that wrap the larger cloud providers in easier to use services, others that have their own servers. If all you need is computers, then pick a service with a data center near your customer base and load up a virtual machine that can handle what you need. If you need something specific, then, honestly no you don't. If you're building greenfield then you want to try and be as non-commital as possible, if google raises their prices then you want to be able to jump ship to amazon, if amazon raises their prices, then jump ship to azure, if again you don't mind Alibaba jump ship there. There we have it that open source software has made at least early stage vendor lock in substantially less intense, you may have to change a front end piece of your code to change from Lambda Cloud to an IBM function, but you can still change. And if you're using containerized applications like docker, then you can change without really adjusting anything other than your deploy instructions. 

## Desktops and Laptops
So you have say... 10 employees. Or you expect to scale to that number of employees fairly quickly. How are you going to manage computing for all of these people. Are you going to have everyone in an office, or are you supporting work from home plans. Do these employees need to run specialized software, or are they doing office work type tasks. All of these are going to determine what you need to get. To be fair I haven't done a fleet deployment so these opinions are just that, opinions. 

- Bring your own Laptop. This is the cheapest option for you you, but it is also begging for trouble. You have no control over the hardware. You have minimal control over the software. You have no guarantee of security. You have no guantee of reliabilty. You have no guarantee of support. You have no guarantee of compatibility. You have no guarantee of anything. This is still quite often the direction people go with, but I'm not a fan. For one thing, it's foisting what I would consider the employers reponsibility off onto the employee, and if you're not paying appropriately for that responsibility, it's really not fair. Then companies wanting to protect their data will ask employees to sign their systems into a device management and negatively impact their employees ability to enjoy their own laptops during their own off time. Then you have the scenarios where an employee leaves, and will likely be taking any data they loaded onto their machine with them. 

- Buy a Fleet of Machines. You have 10 employees, you need probably 10 laptops, plus a couple spare. This is where ditching the individual consumer mindset becomes important. You don't want to be limited when a machine fails. Don't fall into the trap of thinking of this as a one time expense. Or thinking you'll replace them as they die. It's far more effective to plan on their failure at a specific point, before they fail. I may not have done a deployment, but I have taken over active ones, specifically ones that haven't been preplanned appropriately. The we replace as they fail attitude leads to obsolete equipment hanging on for dear life because nobody wants to go through the hassle of replacing it, until you end up with sudden cascade failures of equipment where your hardware fails consistently. Going the fleet route, I lean towards Framework laptops for their easy repairabiltiy. It'd be easy enough for a small company or IT contractor to keep a handful of replacements parts on hand to repair sudden failures, and order replacement parts in advance of scheduled upgrades. The increased upfront costs should likely balance out over the lifetime of the hardware, plus the customizability is ideal for these potential fleet deployments. 

- Use virtual machines. If you don't want to manage all that hardware, one idea that I've floated and seems to have a lot of advantages is using a Desktop as a service (Daas) provider. This is essentially where you use remote desktop for everything. If you have physical hardware, you keep it cheap and dumb such that it's only task is to connect up to the desktop and render it. You could do this either as a single server hosting multiple desktops, or use a more dedicated Daas provider that gives desktops as indiviudal machines with management and control built in. Azure virtual desktops (Microsoft likely makes a lot of sense for hosting these) looks to host roughly $100CAD / month for a team of 10 people connecting up to virtual desktops, although it may be more depending on the exact workload. It may also be less, if you're willing to suffer an initial loading time first thing in the mornings, you're not paying at night. Or on Weekends. Or when you go on a company trip. While this risks a blow up in costs if not correctly configured, it also offers substantial advantages for smooth scaling as a business. Small dumb terminals can be purchased and setup with specialized software for relatively cheap and then your monthly costs guarantee a always functional properly backed up system.

## Your own Server or Cloud hosting
I'm not going to lie, I have a bit of a dislike of services like Squarespace. Don't get me wrong. They can be awesome. And they are easy and quick to set up with a clean looking store front. But all their sites a certain sameness to them. And then once you've made your site, they host it for you. You're locked in unless you want to rebuild your site from scratch. If they were a piece of software you paid $500 for and it exported a site, and they happened to offer a monthly hosting service. I wouldn't mind so much. But the lock in really rubs me the wrong way.

Why did I state $500 when squarespace has a free tier and doesn't have any sort of upfront cost like that. Because really it's just tricking you into not seeing the cost properly. The most basic plan is $252 per year, which being incredibly generous at 5% interest per year is equivalent to roughly $5000 upfront cost. So could you get a clean custom, mobile optimzied site done for that much, well easily. Could you then host it for much less than $21 per month, yeah also easily up to some pretty heavy site traffic. 

- Hosting a website on your own server requires a few things. You want a static IP address and business level internet. If your site goes down you're losing traffic, and money. You also should have a real server. The difference between server and desktop hardware is that server hardware is intended to be run 24/7/365, with minimal downtime. Don't fall into the trap of thinking you need full uptime, going above 99% is going to start costing insane amounts of money. However, 99% is a reasonable target with reasonably priced server hardware. Expect to spend a couple thousand on a good server to last you roughly a decade of service. Ongoing maintenance for security is a must; however, this shouldn't be a major problem with a proper setup. 

- Hosting a website in the cloud, is likely the way to go. Several services exist to consider when it comes to hosting. Services like AWS amplify completely abstract away your frontend requirements, and have options for the backend as well which can make hosting cost as little as dollars a month. If you've paid for a custom designed storefront running on these platforms, you're not going to run into any sort of hosting issues and you can sit back and let Amazon handle hosting your website cleanly. I use amplify for my consulting company website, and i don't pay for hosting because I'm not getting enough traffic to even tick over their free tier. If you have need of a dedicated virtual machine because of how your site is architected, you can get these setup for as little as a few dollars a month, and vertically scale with your demand manually up to massive servers when required.
