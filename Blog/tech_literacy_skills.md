## Skills you Need

1) Every Operating System. Yes I say and mean Every Operating System. 
What most people think I mean is that you need to be equally comfortable in any operating system that you're put in front of. 
That isn't quite it. You need to know the tropes of the big 3 (Windows, MacOS, and Some Generic Linux Desktop). If I put you in front of Mint Linux, then you should be able to open a web browser and operate there. 
If I put you in front of Mac OS you shouldn't run away screaming. 

- Learn the Terminal in Each Operating System. Bash is your friend, even you secretly like to hand out with c-shell on the weekends. 

2) 3... 2... 1... Backup Methodology. 
Don't get caught unawares. Technology fails. Even reliable tech like google drive. You want to have 3 copies of your important data, in at least 2 different physical locations, with at least 1 redundant format. 
This means if you print your photos you care about. Make sure that they aren't stored right next to your computer so that when one bursts into flames unexpectedly, you still have your photos cause you brought the album over to your grandmothers house for safe keeping. 
This means that if you have a file that is critical to you, you have it not just at your office where it can be taken out by a single data faiure. It is also at your home where it can be recovered in the event of a disaster. 
Think the Toy Story movie incident where an employee saved the movie cause they worked from home and prevented a data failure from destroying the whole thing.

- There are a lot of different backup methods of various different levels of technical expertise. Pay more, pay less, just don't come crawling to your local test wizard trying to get data off your broken down harddrive. 
There's good reasons why data recovery from dead drives can get into the many thousands of dollars. It is a pay not or cry later scenario. 

3) Know your password or use a password manager. 
If you're highly technically literate consider investing in a usb key for your password. Or if not, consider investing in a password manager. I won't give you a huge headache if your passwords repeat somewhat. It's terrible practice, but it's terrible practice we all engage in to some extent or another. I will give you hassle if you don't have at least a high-security and a low-security password which you know. 

4) Incognito is not private
Another one of those why doesn't everyone know this. Incognito mode just means that your browser won't remember where you went. This does nothing to stop the people who you connect to from knowing who you are or where you're connecting to. If you truely desire private browsing then use a VPN or even better a ToR browser to make your connections more difficult to track.
