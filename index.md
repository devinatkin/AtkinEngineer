Welcome to my personal portfolio on GitHub Pages. I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering based in Calgary, Alberta. My passion lies in exploring the intricate world of electrical engineering, from theoretical research to practical applications. Through this portfolio, I aim to share my journey, insights, and creations with you.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing my PhD in Electrical Engineering, focusing on CMOS Image Sensors with a smattering of LLM based exploration. I engage in various research projects and hobby projects varying from embedded systems to network management. I try to keep my github.com full of interesting stuff, but sadly there's rarely enough time.

## Blog

In my [Blog](/blog), I share my thoughts, what I'm working on at the moment, and some mild musings. Nothing too serious, and rarely worth others reading, but hopefully some stuff that others may end up finding useful. I've tried to add some language notes into my github, and some platform notes onto my blog section. What board houses, ICs, and even books that I've found worth the read. Some fantasy, some practical.

## Resume

For a detailed look at my professional background, including academic achievements, research projects, and industry experience, visit my [Work With Me](/resume_page.md) page. You'll find information about my skills, publications, and any awards or recognitions I've received. If you're interested in my resume you may also want to see that I have certificates (Ooooo [certificates...](Certificates/certificates.md))

## Projects

My [Projects](/projects) page showcases a portfolio of my work, featuring both practical applications developed during my work and fun projects I've undertaken over the years. This is by far the most underdeveloped portion of this site as the most interesting projects often have someone who doesn't necessarily want them published at the time.
