# A list of projects I've undertaken. 
I haven't finished transferring things over to this website... I also in general need to get better at documenting my hoppy projects. 

- [TIL311](Projects\TIL311\TIL311)  
- [Icosahedron](Projects\Icosahedron\Icosahedron)
- [TT04](Projects\TT04\TT04)
- [TT05 Stop Watch Test](Projects\TT05\TT05StopWatch)

## Old Old Projects from the past (What Little Documentation Remains of them)

Maybe if I get around to it I'll do something better with some of the ideas I played with and go from there. 
For now it's a graveyard.
