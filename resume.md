## Summary

I am finishing my PhD in Electrical Engineering and expect to complete it within the year. I am eager to transition into industry and apply my expertise to real-world challenges. 
My technical background spans all scales of electrical engineering from Low Voltage to High Voltage, from nanometers to kilometers. 
The diversity of my technical background has given me a wide base that allows me to quickly adapt to new technologies and environments in a meaningful way. 
I am seeking a role where I can contribute meaningfully to the organization while gaining greater technical expertise.
I am always down for a new adventure and live by the mantra that a jack of all trades, master of none, is still always better than master of one.
