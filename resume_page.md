# Work With Me

I’m an Electrical Engineering PhD candidate specialising in hardware-heavy engineering:
embedded systems, FPGA development, PCB design, and test/validation.
My work tends to sit in the gap between “it compiles” and “it survives reality”.

If you’re hiring for roles where someone needs to **build, debug, validate, and document**
hardware and systems end-to-end, I’m likely a good fit.

## What I’m looking for
Full-time roles in:
- Product validation / hardware test engineering
- Embedded systems engineering
- FPGA / digital design engineering
- Analog/ Mixed Signal Design
- Hardware systems integration

I’m also open to short-term consulting for well-scoped engineering work.
